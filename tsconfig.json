/*
  Why that paths ?
  - `@/*` is used to import from the `src` directory, allowing for cleaner imports like `import { MyComponent } from '@/components/MyComponent'`.
  - `~/*` is used to import from the root directory, which can be useful for importing files that are not in the `src` directory.
  - `@/convex/*` is used to import from the `convex` directory, allowing for cleaner imports like `import { MyConvexFunction } from '@/convex/myConvexFunction'`.
